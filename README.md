This project was done during my internship at Advanced Analytics Engineering Center (AAEC), it is located
at the faculty of of Computer Science and Mathematics (FSKM UiTM), Shah Alam, Malaysia.

# Goal of the project
Monuments classification based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from sratch and using pretrained models.

# Folder 1: Data


It contains 5 subfolders, each represents a specific monument, i choosed to work with:
* Big Ben ; 
* Taj Mahal ; 
* Eiffel Tower ; 
* Statue of Liberty ; 
* Petronas Towers

# Folder 2: icons


It contains images used in the interface.

# Folder 3: test


It contains random images to test the model via `Interface.ipynb` notebook.

# Notebooks:


* `Model_From_Sractch.ipynb`: Building the CNN model from sratch without using pretrained models ;
* `Xception_Pretrained_model.ipynb`: Implementation of the pretrained model Xception ;
* `Inceptionv3_Pretrained_model.ipynb` : Implementation of the pretrained model Inceptionv3 ;
* `VGG19_Pretrained_model.ipynb`: Implementation of the pretrained model VGG with 19 layers.
* `Interface.ipynb`: The user can test the model on unseed data (test folder) via a desktop application developed using tkinter, and get the location of the monument.

# Remarks:

In the `Report.pdf` and `Presentation.pdf`, you will find a detailed comparaison between different approaches used in this project.
